        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Robert Brasso. I am a Graduate student at Towson University working on my Master of Computer Science degree. The area of study that fascinates me the most is Data Science. With the massive amounts of data that is collected through technology, we have the ability to improve and optimize nearly every facet of our existence. The reason I have made this website is to catalog my steps towards becoming a successful data scientist. I will post all of my projects in the Projects section of my website. If you have any ideas for projects you'd like to see, feel free to reach out to me using the information on the Contacts section of this website. If you need anything in data scientist done, don't hestitate to reach out to me. I'm happy to work on projects big or small. If you don't have the financial means to afford data analysis on a specific, we can always work something else out.

        <!--I am an IT professional working in Systems and Network administration. I have been working in IT since 2010. As a seasoned IT administrator, I have experience managing Windows enterprise environments, planning and implementing networks of various types, managing databases, developing websites and applications, configuring and managing VOIP systems, configuring and installing servers (both Linux and Windows),  purchasing and installing hardware components, and troubleshooting any problem put in front of me. I have worked both as a IT manager supporting one company and as a IT administrator supporting dozens of clients simultaneously. I am passionate about people and technology, as shown by my Bachelor of Sociology degree and my current work towards my Master of Computer Science degree. While I have a lot of knowledge and understanding about how technology works, my strongest trait is the joy I get in interacting with people on a daily basis. I am a natural problem solver and the best part of my career in IT is the ability to share that trait with people that need it on a daily basis.--> </p>
        <p> If you have any leads on work or would like to enlist me to do a project for you, please send me a private message on <a href="http://facebook.com/rbrasso">Facebook</a>. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website and I hope what you have found here will be of some use to you!</p>
